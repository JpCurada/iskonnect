## Our Logo

The design behind our ISKOnnect logo tells its own story:

The "i" in the Middle — It's more than just a letter. Shaped like a pencil, it stands for the tools that every Iskolar uses to write, create, and learn. Simple but meaningful, just like the students who use them.

The Book/Files in the Background — Look around the "i" and you'll see books or files coming together. This shows what ISKOnnect is about — students sharing what they know, helping each other out with resources they've made themselves.

The Owl — Up at the top sits an owl, known everywhere as a symbol of wisdom. But for us PUPians, it means something more. Those tired but determined eyes? They're for every Iskolar pulling all-nighters, proving that real learning doesn't stop when the sun sets. It's a friendly nod to everyone who's ever said "one more chapter" at 3 AM.

## About ISKOnnect

ISKOnnect is a desktop application made for PUP students to help each other excel in their studies. Think of it as a digital library made by students, for students — where everyone can share reviewers, notes, and practice tests.

To make studying more fun and rewarding, we've added badges and titles that students can earn by sharing good study materials. When you start sharing, you're a "Fresh Contributor." Share more helpful reviewers and you could become a "Junior Mentor" or even reach the "PUP Hall of Famer" status.

The best part is how easy it is to find what you need. Everything is listed by college and course, so Engineering students can find Math reviewers right away, while Communication students can get writing guides quickly. Plus, students can upvote materials they find helpful, so you know which ones work best.

## How ISKOnnect Works

In ISKOnnect, we applied Object-Oriented Programming's **inheritance** concept in several key areas of the application.

First, in the Model layer, we implemented a strong inheritance hierarchy starting with the abstract User class. This base class holds common attributes that every user needs — like userId, firstName, lastName, and email. Instead of duplicating these properties, we created two child classes: Student and Admin, which inherit from User. This means both Student and Admin automatically get all the base User properties and methods, but they can also have their own unique features. For example, the Student class adds points and badges for the gamification system, while the Admin class includes special permissions for content moderation.

Second, we applied inheritance in our view structure through base.fxml. This base layout serves as a template that contains common elements like the navigation sidebar and main content area. Both student and admin interfaces extend this base layout, following the "extend and modify" principle of inheritance. When a student logs in, their view inherits from base.fxml but adds student-specific elements like the materials grid and upload button. Similarly, the admin view inherits the same base but adds admin-specific components like the reports table and user management tools.

Third, inheritance is evident in how we handle root scenes in the Main class. Instead of creating separate scene management for student and admin views, we created a parent root handling system. This parent system defines common scene-setting behavior, which is then extended for specific user types. When users log in, the appropriate root is set based on their user type, but the underlying scene management remains consistent thanks to inheritance.

Lastly, we applied inheritance in our services layer to handle database operations. We created base service classes with common CRUD operations, which specific services like MaterialService and UserService extend. This means services inherit basic database interaction methods but can add their own specialized functionality. For example, MaterialService inherits basic save and retrieve operations but adds specific methods for handling file uploads and vote counting.

This application of inheritance helped us achieve cleaner code, reduce duplication, and make the system more maintainable. It also made it easier to add new features since we could extend existing functionality rather than writing everything from scratch.
